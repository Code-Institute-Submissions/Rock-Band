## Testing
I used the google chrome extensions to check the responsivity and contents of website.
 - Viewport Resizer 
 - HTML5 Outliner

Safari browser on iMac and iPhone (in horizontal and vertical layout)
I changed the browser size to see how all elements interact with each other and change their layout and size. I have clicked on the various menu links to check the smooth page scrolling and the "Move Up" button in different position of the page to see the reaction.
